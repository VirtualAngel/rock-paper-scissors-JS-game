Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
Phase Two

This project will have three phases:
    Phase One: HTML and JS (Can set up some CSS classes if you want)
    Phase Two: CSS (Design and Styling)
    Phase Three: Add a score keeper

***///*** Work off of your code from Phase One ***///***

1. Design your page. Make sure your fonts are readable, and their color contrasts highly with the background. You can find many color contrast sites online.
		WebAIM: https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/
		Coolors: https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/112a46-acc8e5
		Adobe Color: https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer
	A. Draw out your design on a piece of paper. Where are you going to place buttons? Where is your text going to go? Where are the containers going to be placed?
	B. (Optional) You can use a free design tool called Figma - just create an account: 
        i. Watch this tutorial on how to use Figma:
        ii. Begin designing with accessibility in mind.
        iii. You can add icons for rock, paper, scissors hands: https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1144676442624326325/Font-Awesome-Icons-by-Iconduck
