Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
Phase Three
This project will have three phases:
    Phase One: HTML and JS (Can set up some CSS classes if you want)
    Phase Two: Add a score keeper
    Phase Three: CSS (Design and Styling)

***///*** Work off of your code from Phase One and Two ***///***

You'll use:
HTML
CSS (Flexbox, Grid, or both)
Figma (Optional)

1. Design your page. Make sure your fonts are readable, and their color contrasts highly with the background. You can find many color contrast sites online.
		WebAIM: https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/
		Coolors: https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/112a46-acc8e5
		Adobe Color: https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer
	A. Draw out your design on a piece of paper. Where are you going to place buttons? Where is your text going to go? Where are the containers going to be placed?
	B. (Optional) You can use a free design tool called Figma - just create an account: https://www.figma.com/
        i. Watch this tutorial on how to use Figma: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIfNp1wScwk
        ii. Begin designing with accessibility in mind.
        iii. You can add icons for rock, paper, scissors hands: https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1144676442624326325/Font-Awesome-Icons-by-Iconduck

            Note: We'll add the Scorekeeper in Phase Three
2. Time to do some styling! Pro tip: work off of your design. It's ok to change things as you go if you find something that works better.
    A. In HTML create your containers, but use semantic HTML (Section, Article, Button, etc.) instead of divs where you can:
        i. Header
        ii. Main Container
        iii. Child Containers
        iv. Buttons
    B. Think ahead, what CSS classes are you going to need to style these elements and make them responsive?
        i. Are you going to use Flexbox, Grid, or a combination of both?
        ii. Time to brush up on what you learned for media queries!
    C. As you work at styling your page, test the changes you make often.
