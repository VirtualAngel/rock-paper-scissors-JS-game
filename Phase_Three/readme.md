Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
Phase Three
This project will have three phases:
    Phase One: HTML and JS (Can set up some CSS classes if you want)
    Phase Two: Add a score keeper
    Phase Three: CSS (Design and Styling)

***///*** Work off of your code from Phase One and Two ***///***

You'll use:
HTML
CSS (Flexbox, Grid, or both)
Figma (Optional)

If you get stuck, Kevin Powell has some excellent videos on HTML and CSS on his YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell

1. Work off your design from Phase One. If you skipped this step, now is a good time to revisit it:
     Make sure your fonts are readable, and their color contrasts highly with the background. You can find many color contrast sites online.

	A. Draw out your design on a piece of paper. Where are you going to place buttons? Where is your text going to go? Where are the containers going to be placed?
	B. (Optional) You can use a free design tool called Figma - just create an account: https://www.figma.com/
        i. Watch this tutorial on how to use Figma: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIfNp1wScwk
        ii. Begin designing with accessibility in mind.
        iii. You can add icons for rock, paper, scissors hands: https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1144676442624326325/Font-Awesome-Icons-by-Iconduck

2. Time to do some styling! Pro tip: work off of your design. It's ok to change things as you go if you find something that works better.
    A. In HTML create your containers, but use semantic HTML (Section, Article, Button, etc.) instead of divs where you can:
        i. Header
        ii. Main Container
        iii. Child Containers
        iv. Buttons
    B. Think ahead, what CSS classes are you going to need to style these elements and make them responsive?
        i. Are you going to use Flexbox, Grid, or a combination of both?
        ii. Time to brush up on what you learned for media queries!
    C. Set up your global CSS styles first - colors, font types, margins, etc.
        i. This is a good time to practice using the :root selector. It'll make you life so much easier!

        ii. Code for mobile-size first.
    D. Target the classes or IDs from your HTML.
        i. Style these so they look like your mockup.
        ii. Test often to make sure new styles work with previous ones.
3. If you run into problems, Google and YouTube are great free resources.
4. Happy coding!
